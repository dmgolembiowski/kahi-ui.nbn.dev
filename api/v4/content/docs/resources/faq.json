Visit <a href=\"https://github.com/novacbn/kahi-ui/releases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Releases</a> and grab the <code>.css</code> distributable files, and read the library source code on how to do markup, progressive enhancements, etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"can-i-use-the-library-on-browsers-that-dont-support-or-have-javascript-disabled\">Can I use the library on Browsers that don't support or have Javascript disabled?</h2>\n<p>Yes! The library is explictly made in mind that Svelte should be used to sprinkle extra functionality ontop of logic baked in HTML / CSS.

It is currently not being pursued and will be tackled at a later date.
